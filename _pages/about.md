Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [National Laboratory of the Rockies (formerly named NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/) in Boulder, Colorado. My research lies at the intersection of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and the physical sciences, specifically within the domain of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2023, advised by [Prof. Claire Monteleoni](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/claire-monteleoni/). My academic foundation was built at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, where I earned my Integrated BS and MS in Mathematics and Computing.

At the lab, I am working in the Artificial Intelligence, Learning, and Intelligent Systems (ALIS) group, developing multimodal generative AI systems for building energy modeling and investigating LLMs to enhance scientific reasoning.

Previously, I have worked on modelling environmental impacts:
- **Sea-level Predictions**: Building ML frameworks to fuse climate model simulations with satellite altimetry for future sea-level rise projections.
- **Renewable Energy Forecasting**: Developing deep sequence learning architectures for probabilistic solar irradiance forecasting.
- **Extreme Event Detection**: Using unsupervised deep learning to detect anomalies like avalanches from satellite imagery. (Spotlight talk at a NeurIPS workshop: [link](https://slideslive.com/38922417/detecting-avalanche-deposits-using-variational-autoencoder-on-sentinel1-satellite-imagery))

My long-term research goal is to develop physics-informed and interpretable AI systems that enhance scientific reasoning and transparency in high-stakes scientific applications.

Outside of research, I love to cook, watch tennis, and bike, and I am enjoying my time in Boulder!

### Teaching Philosophy

I believe education has the power to shape a person, and in doing so, shape the society. Growing up in one of the economically disadvantaged states in India, I was fortunate to be raised by an educated mother who instilled in me the belief that education is the most powerful tool for shaping one’s future. My goal has always been to make learning enjoyable, making complex material accessible and engaging.
